# LinkSaver

Link saver is a web app that makes managing bookmarks a pleasant experience.  I created Link Saver for my second project at the IronHack Web Development Bootcamp. My goal for this project was to create a simple and clean interface for interacting with bookmarks with full CRUD. Along with that, I also wanted a way to view other peoples public bookmarks and folders.
